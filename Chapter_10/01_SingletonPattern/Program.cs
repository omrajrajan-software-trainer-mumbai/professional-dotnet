/*Program to demonstrate Singleton pattern in C# with Visual studio
Programmar :- Nikhil Patil*/



/*
Definition:
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Applications:
Managing shared resources such as a database connection pool or a configuration manager.
Logging mechanisms where a single logger instance is required.
Accessing thread pools.

/*
 Explanation of Code:
sealed class Singleton:
Ensures the class cannot be inherited, preventing additional instances from being created.

private static Singleton _instance:
Holds the single instance of the class, initially set to null.

private static readonly object _lock:
Used to synchronize access across multiple threads to ensure only one instance is created.

private Singleton():
The constructor is private, restricting object creation from outside the class.

Double-checked locking in the Instance property:
First checks if _instance is null. If true, it locks the block of code and checks again before instantiating, ensuring thread safety.

ShowMessage method:
Demonstrates that the Singleton object can perform actions.

Main method:
Accesses the Singleton instance and demonstrates that multiple calls refer to the same instance.
