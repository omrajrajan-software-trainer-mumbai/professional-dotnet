/*
Definition
The Flyweight design pattern is a structural design pattern that minimizes memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects.
It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share similar characteristics.

The pattern separates intrinsic state (shared, invariant data) from extrinsic state (unique, context-specific data), allowing the former to be reused.

Code Explanation
Flyweight Interface (IShape):
Defines a contract for flyweight objects.
Includes a method Draw(string color) that uses the extrinsic state (e.g., color).

Concrete Flyweight Class (Circle):
Implements the IShape interface.
Maintains intrinsic state (_shapeType), which is invariant and shared across instances.
Uses the extrinsic state (color) provided by the client to perform operations.

Flyweight Factory (ShapeFactory):
Manages a pool of flyweight objects (_shapes dictionary).
Ensures that shared objects are reused and not duplicated.
Provides utility methods like TotalShapesCreated() for debugging.

Client Code:
Requests flyweight instances from the ShapeFactory.
Passes extrinsic state (e.g., color) to the flyweight objects during operations.
Demonstrates how multiple operations can reuse the same shared object.

Memory Efficiency:
Instead of creating a new Circle instance for each Draw() call, the factory reuses a single instance, minimizing memory usage.
