Proxy Design Pattern

Definition:
The Proxy design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a placeholder or surrogate object to control access to another object.
It allows additional functionality, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching, without modifying the actual object's code.

/*
Code Explanation
Subject Interface (IImage):
Defines the common interface for both the real object(RealImage) and the proxy object(ProxyImage).
Ensures the client can use either the proxy or the real object interchangeably.

Real Subject(RealImage):
Implements the IImage interface.
Simulates a costly operation (LoadFromDisk()) during object creation.
Contains the core logic for the Display() method.

Proxy (ProxyImage):
Implements the same interface (IImage) as the real subject.
Maintains a reference to the real subject (_realImage) and performs lazy initialization.
Delegates method calls to the real object when needed.
Adds additional behavior, such as controlling when and how the real object is instantiated.

Client Code:
The client interacts with the proxy (ProxyImage) instead of the real object (RealImage).
The proxy ensures that the real object is loaded from disk only when required, thereby optimizing performance.
