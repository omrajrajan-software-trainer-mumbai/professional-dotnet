// Program to demonstrate Basic Demonstration of Boxing and Unboxing in C# with Visual Studio
// Programmer: Nikhil Patil

/*
    Boxing occurs when a value type is converted to an object type or any interface type it implements.
    The value is copied to the heap, and a reference to that heap memory is created.
    Unboxing is the reverse operation, extracting the value type from the object.
